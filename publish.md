# Publish Prototype to Playground

You are helping a designer publish an HTML prototype to the Prototype Playground.

## What the user will provide

1. **The HTML file path** — where the prototype file is on their computer
2. **The prototype name** — a short, descriptive name
3. **A screenshot** (optional) — a preview image for the dashboard card

If they don't provide a description, generate a brief one based on the prototype name.

## Finding a screenshot automatically

If the user doesn't explicitly provide a screenshot, **ask if they want to include one**. If they say yes, find the most recent screenshot on their Desktop:

```bash
ls -t ~/Desktop/Screenshot*.png 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

Show them the filename and ask if that's the right one before using it.

If the user says something like "use the latest screenshot" or "grab my screenshot", find it automatically using the command above.

## Playground location

- Repo: `~/Documents/prototype-playground`
- Prototypes folder: `~/Documents/prototype-playground/prototypes/`
- Images folder: `~/Documents/prototype-playground/images/`
- Manifest: `~/Documents/prototype-playground/prototypes.json`
- Live dashboard: `https://mac-gorgias.github.io/prototype-playground`

## Steps to publish

1. **Generate a filename slug** from the prototype name (lowercase, hyphens, no special characters). Example: "AI Agent Onboarding V2" → `ai-agent-onboarding-v2.html`

2. **Copy the HTML file**:
   ```bash
   cp "<SOURCE_FILE>" ~/Documents/prototype-playground/prototypes/<slug>.html
   ```

3. **If a screenshot is provided or found**, copy it to the images folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/Documents/prototype-playground/images
   cp "<SCREENSHOT_PATH>" ~/Documents/prototype-playground/images/<slug>.png
   ```
   If the source image is .jpg or .jpeg or .webp, keep that extension instead.

4. **Update prototypes.json** — Read the current JSON array, then append a new entry:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "<PROTOTYPE_NAME>",
     "author": "Mac",
     "date": "<TODAY YYYY-MM-DD>",
     "description": "<DESCRIPTION>",
     "file": "<slug>.html",
     "image": "<slug>.png"
   }
   ```
   Only include the `"image"` field if a screenshot was provided.
   Write the updated array back to prototypes.json with proper formatting.

5. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/prototype-playground
   git pull --rebase
   git add -A
   git commit -m "add: <PROTOTYPE_NAME>"
   git push
   ```

6. **Share the links**:
   - Prototype: `https://mac-gorgias.github.io/prototype-playground/prototypes/<slug>.html`
   - Dashboard: `https://mac-gorgias.github.io/prototype-playground`

## Example prompts the user might say

- "Publish ~/Downloads/onboarding.html as 'AI Agent Onboarding V2'"  → ask if they want to include a screenshot
- "Publish this with my latest screenshot" → find most recent screenshot on Desktop
- "Publish ~/Downloads/sms.html as 'SMS Builder' with screenshot ~/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-03-02.png"
- "Add a screenshot to the existing AI Agent Onboarding V2 prototype" → update the image field and copy the image

## Updating an existing prototype

If the user wants to update a prototype that already exists:
1. Replace the HTML file in prototypes/
2. If a new screenshot is provided, replace the image in images/
3. Update the entry in prototypes.json (match by filename slug)
4. Commit and push
